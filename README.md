  ## Description
  This project took a fully functional MERN stack application that used RESTFUL API methods and converted it to use an Apollo Client / Server and GraphQL.
  ## Installation
  If you'd like to fork this repo and clone it to your local machine you can `npm install` to grab the necessary node modules and then `npm run develop` to run it on your local machine, instead of using the deployed link.
  ## Usage
  This application demonstrates my ability to migrate an applications existing technology to a different one. As far as the usefulness of the actual application, it would be a good way for someone to keep track of books they would like to read or books that they have already read.
